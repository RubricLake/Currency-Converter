### By: Ethan Kigotho

### Synopsis:
#### This project is a quick and easy to use currency converter. You simply imput the symbol of the starting currency, the amount you want to convert, and the symbol of the destination currency. Once Convert is pressed, text will appear telling you your conversion amount.

### Tools Used:
* Python
* Custom Tkinter (Modernized Tkinter Library)
* Json library (Reading in Data)
* Requests library (API)

### The Why:
#### I wanted to make this project mainly because I'm looking to try out new things. When I found out about tkinter, I was off put by it's older look. Then, whenever I came across Custom Tkinter, I wanted to try my hand at a library that is relatively new as well as incorporate API usage.

### Notes:
#### An API key is required for the usage of this program. You can find one at https://www.exchangerate-api.com. Once made, simply insert your API key where [YOUR-API-KEY-HERE] is written in main.py.

#### Sorry for the inconvenience.
